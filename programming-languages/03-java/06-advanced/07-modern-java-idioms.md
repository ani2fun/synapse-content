# Modern Java Idioms & the Type System, Holistically

You've met the modern features one at a time — [records and sealed types](/synapse/programming-languages/java/core-libraries/enums-and-records), [pattern matching](/synapse/programming-languages/java/robust-oop/sealed-classes-and-pattern-matching), [`Optional` and streams](/synapse/programming-languages/java/advanced/functional-java-and-streams), `var`. This chapter shows they're not a grab-bag of tricks but a **coherent design**. Together, **`record` + `sealed` + pattern matching** give *data-oriented programming*: model your data as a closed set of immutable shapes, and let the compiler force you to handle every one. **`Optional`** pushes `null` out of your domain at the edges. **Immutability** makes objects safe to share, and **`var`** removes redundant noise. The thesis is composition: each feature is good alone, but their real power is how they fit together into code that is concise, safe, and checked.

💡 **The core idea.**

- The modern features aren't a grab-bag — they compose into **one coherent design**.
- **`record` + `sealed` + pattern matching** give data-oriented programming with compiler-checked exhaustiveness.
- **`Optional`** pushes `null` out at the edges; **immutability** makes objects safe to share; **`var`** cuts noise.
- The real power is **composition** — how the features fit together.

This synthesizes Tiers 3–5. Every output below was produced by compiling and running the code.

📘 **How to read the Intuition boxes.** Each one is built in three moves:

1. **The mechanism** — what the compiler and the JVM are *actually doing*.
2. **A concrete bite** — a specific, runnable failure (often a real compiler error), shown so the trap is visible.
3. **The earned rule** — the decision heuristic, now justified rather than asserted, plus its cost.

## 1. Data-oriented design: records + sealed + patterns

The three features lock together: a **`sealed`** interface defines a closed set of cases, each case is an immutable **`record`**, and a **pattern `switch`** consumes them — destructuring components and, because the set is closed, checked for exhaustiveness with no `default`.

```java run viz=array:shapes
sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rectangle, Triangle {}
record Circle(double radius) implements Shape {}
record Rectangle(double width, double height) implements Shape {}
record Triangle(double base, double height) implements Shape {}

public class Main {
    static double area(Shape s) {
        return switch (s) {
            case Circle(double r) -> Math.PI * r * r;
            case Rectangle(double w, double h) -> w * h;
            case Triangle(double b, double h) -> 0.5 * b * h;
        };
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape[] shapes = { new Circle(2), new Rectangle(3, 4), new Triangle(6, 8) };
        for (Shape s : shapes) {
            System.out.printf("%s -> %.2f%n", s.getClass().getSimpleName(), area(s));
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Circle -> 12.57
Rectangle -> 12.00
Triangle -> 24.00
```

```d2
direction: down

record: "record\nimmutable data shape" { shape: rectangle }
sealed: "sealed\nclosed set of cases" { shape: rectangle }
pattern: "pattern switch\nconsume + destructure" { shape: rectangle }
exhaustive: "exhaustiveness\ncompiler-checked" { shape: rectangle }

dop: "data-oriented design" {
  shape: package
}

record -> dop: "the shapes"
sealed -> dop: "the closed set"
pattern -> dop: "the operations"
dop -> exhaustive: "guarantees"
```

**Analysis.** Each shape is a one-line `record` (data with generated `equals`/`hashCode`/`toString`); `sealed` declares the *complete* set; and the pattern `switch` destructures each (`Circle(double r)`) to compute its area — with **no `default`**, because the compiler knows the set is closed. The data lives in the records, the behavior lives in the `switch` (outside the data), and the type system guarantees every case is handled. That's data-oriented programming: a closed algebra of data, with operations added externally.

**Intuition.**
*Mechanism.* `sealed` gives the compiler the full list of subtypes; record patterns bind components directly; the exhaustive `switch` is verified complete. The three features share one purpose — making a closed set of data shapes safe to process.

*Concrete bite.* The payoff is the compiler as a checklist: as [Tutorial 26 verified](/synapse/programming-languages/java/robust-oop/sealed-classes-and-pattern-matching), adding a fourth permitted shape makes *every* non-exhaustive `switch` stop compiling until you handle it — "the switch expression does not cover all possible input values." Compare the [inheritance](/synapse/programming-languages/java/robust-oop/inheritance-and-polymorphism) alternative (an `abstract double area()` per subclass): use polymorphism when behavior travels *with* open subtypes; use sealed + patterns when the type set is *closed* and operations are added from outside.

<div style="border-left:4px solid #195045;background:rgba(25,80,69,0.08);padding:0.6rem 1rem;border-radius:0 0.5rem 0.5rem 0;margin:1.25rem 0">

💡 **Earned rule.** Reach for `record` + `sealed` + pattern `switch` to model closed sets of structured data — results, events, AST nodes, protocol messages — and process them exhaustively. The cost is choosing this over class polymorphism (and maintaining the `permits` list, which the compiler enforces); the benefit is concise, immutable data plus operations the compiler proves complete — a whole class of "forgot a case" bugs eliminated.

## 2. `Optional` over `null`

`null` is the [billion-dollar mistake](/synapse/programming-languages/java/classes-and-objects/references-equality-and-the-object-model) — invisible in the type, fatal when dereferenced. The idiom is to keep `null` out of your domain: wrap a maybe-absent value in `Optional` at the boundary, and chain `map`/`filter`/`orElse` to handle absence declaratively.

```java run viz=hashmap:config
import java.util.Optional;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {
    static Optional<String> lookup(Map<String, String> m, String key) {
        return Optional.ofNullable(m.get(key));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, String> config = Map.of("host", "localhost", "port", "8080");
        String host = lookup(config, "host").map(String::toUpperCase).orElse("UNKNOWN");
        String region = lookup(config, "region").orElse("us-east");
        int port = lookup(config, "port").map(Integer::parseInt).orElse(80);
        System.out.println(host);
        System.out.println(region);
        System.out.println(port);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
LOCALHOST
us-east
8080
```

**Analysis.** `lookup` wraps the possibly-`null` `map.get` in `Optional.ofNullable`, so absence becomes a typed `Optional.empty()` — never a raw `null` escaping into the program. The callers then *compose*: `host` was present, so `map(String::toUpperCase)` ran and `orElse` was skipped; `region` was absent, so `map` was skipped and `orElse("us-east")` supplied the default; `port` was present and parsed. No `if (x != null)`, no `NullPointerException` — absence is handled by the chain.

**Intuition.**
*Mechanism.* `Optional` makes "might be absent" part of the *type*, so the compiler forces you to deal with it before extracting a value. `map` transforms only if present; `orElse`/`orElseGet` supply defaults; the value can't be used as if present when it isn't.

*Concrete bite.* The discipline is to convert at the boundary and never let `null` leak inward — `Optional.ofNullable` at the edge, an `Optional` return type for "may not find one." But `Optional` is for *return values*, not fields or parameters (a `null` `Optional` field is the worst of both worlds), and `opt.get()` on empty throws, so it isn't a license to skip handling.

<div style="border-left:4px solid #195045;background:rgba(25,80,69,0.08);padding:0.6rem 1rem;border-radius:0 0.5rem 0.5rem 0;margin:1.25rem 0">

💡 **Earned rule.** Return `Optional<T>` from methods that may find nothing, build it with `ofNullable` at boundaries, and consume it with `map`/`filter`/`orElse`; keep `null` out of your domain logic. The cost is wrapping/unwrapping and discipline about where `Optional` belongs (returns, not fields); the benefit is that "absent" is a checked, composable case instead of a runtime crash.

## 3. Immutability and `var`

Modern Java leans on **immutable** objects — `record`s and `final` fields — because an object that can't change is safe to share, cache, and use as a key, with no defensive copies and no aliasing surprises. And **`var`** removes redundant type noise where the right-hand side already says the type.

```java run
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    record Point(int x, int y) {
        Point translate(int dx, int dy) { return new Point(x + dx, y + dy); }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var origin = new Point(0, 0);
        var moved = origin.translate(3, 4);
        System.out.println(origin);
        System.out.println(moved);
        var names = List.of("Ada", "Linus");
        System.out.println(names.size());
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Point[x=0, y=0]
Point[x=3, y=4]
2
```

**Analysis.** `Point` is immutable, so `translate` doesn't mutate — it returns a *new* `Point`, leaving `origin` untouched (`Point[x=0, y=0]`) while `moved` is the new value (`Point[x=3, y=4]`). This "transform by producing a new value" is the immutable idiom (like a `String` operation). `var` inferred the types — `Point`, `Point`, `List<String>` — from the initializers, cutting noise without losing the [static type](/synapse/programming-languages/java/first-steps/variables-and-primitive-types) (it's still fully typed).

**Intuition.**
*Mechanism.* An immutable object's state is fixed at construction; "changes" allocate a new object. That makes it inherently thread-safe and alias-safe (nothing can change it behind your back). `var` is pure compile-time inference — the variable has a concrete type, just not spelled out.

*Concrete bite.* Immutability has the cost you'd expect: "updating" deep structures means rebuilding them, and very hot allocation paths may matter — but as [Tutorial 21 verified](/synapse/programming-languages/java/core-libraries/enums-and-records), a `record`'s components are `final` and can't be reassigned, which is exactly what makes sharing safe. And `var` aids brevity, not obscurity: use it when the initializer makes the type obvious (`var p = new Point(...)`), not when it hides a non-obvious type.

<div style="border-left:4px solid #195045;background:rgba(25,80,69,0.08);padding:0.6rem 1rem;border-radius:0 0.5rem 0.5rem 0;margin:1.25rem 0">

💡 **Earned rule.** Default to immutability (`record`s, `final` fields, transform-by-new) for data you share or use as keys, and use `var` where the type is obvious from the right-hand side. The cost is extra allocations and verbosity for deep updates (immutability) and potential opacity if overused (`var`); the benefit is data that's safe to share without defensive copies and code with less redundant ceremony.

## 4. Composing it all

The features earn their keep *together*. Here a small domain — payments — uses `sealed` + `record`s for the data, a pattern `switch` for behavior, a [stream](/synapse/programming-languages/java/advanced/functional-java-and-streams) to aggregate, and `Optional` for a query that might find nothing:

```java run viz=array:payments
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

public class Main {
    sealed interface Payment permits Cash, Card {}
    record Cash(double amount) implements Payment {}
    record Card(double amount, String last4) implements Payment {}

    static double fee(Payment p) {
        return switch (p) {
            case Cash c -> 0.0;
            case Card c -> c.amount() * 0.03;
        };
    }
    static double amountOf(Payment p) {
        return switch (p) {
            case Cash c -> c.amount();
            case Card c -> c.amount();
        };
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Payment> payments = List.of(
            new Cash(100), new Card(200, "1234"), new Card(50, "9999"));
        double totalFees = payments.stream().mapToDouble(Main::fee).sum();
        Optional<Payment> biggest = payments.stream()
            .max((a, b) -> Double.compare(amountOf(a), amountOf(b)));
        System.out.printf("total fees: %.2f%n", totalFees);
        System.out.println("biggest: " + biggest.map(p -> p.getClass().getSimpleName()).orElse("none"));
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
total fees: 7.50
biggest: Card
```

**Analysis.** Five features in one short program: `sealed Payment` (closed set) of `record`s (immutable data); a pattern `switch` computing each payment's `fee` (cash is free, card is 3% — `6.00 + 1.50 = 7.50`); a `stream().mapToDouble(...).sum()` aggregating fees; and `stream().max(...)` returning an `Optional<Payment>` consumed with `map(...).orElse("none")`. Each feature does its job and they compose cleanly — data, behavior, aggregation, and absence-handling, with the compiler checking the switches are exhaustive and `null` nowhere in sight.

**Intuition.**
*Mechanism.* The composition works because the features share a philosophy: make data explicit and immutable (records), make the set of cases closed and checkable (sealed), make operations declarative (patterns, streams), and make absence a type (Optional). They were designed to fit.

*Concrete bite.* This is "data-oriented" Java — declarative, like the [stream pipelines](/synapse/programming-languages/java/advanced/functional-java-and-streams) of a few chapters ago, but with the compiler enforcing exhaustiveness and types throughout. The trade-off is knowing when to use it: this style shines for data-processing and modeling closed domains; classic OOP (encapsulated mutable objects with polymorphic behavior) still fits stateful, open-ended designs.

<div style="border-left:4px solid #195045;background:rgba(25,80,69,0.08);padding:0.6rem 1rem;border-radius:0 0.5rem 0.5rem 0;margin:1.25rem 0">

💡 **Earned rule.** Compose the modern features — sealed records for data, pattern switches and streams for operations, Optional for absence — when modeling and transforming data; reach for classic object-oriented design (mutable state, inheritance) when behavior and identity dominate. The cost is judgment about which paradigm fits; the benefit is that, for the large class of data-shaped problems, modern Java is concise, immutable, and compiler-verified end to end.

## 5. Mental-model summary

| Principle | Consequence |
|---|---|
| `record` + `sealed` + pattern `switch` = data-oriented design | Immutable data, a closed case set, and compiler-checked exhaustive operations |
| Exhaustiveness over a sealed type is compiler-enforced | Add a case and every non-exhaustive `switch` stops compiling — a built-in checklist |
| `Optional` makes absence a type; keep `null` out of the domain | `ofNullable` at boundaries; `map`/`orElse` to handle absence; not for fields |
| Immutability makes objects safe to share; `var` cuts noise | Transform-by-new; `var` where the initializer makes the type obvious |
| The features compose by shared philosophy | Data-oriented Java is concise and checked; classic OOP fits stateful, open designs |

## 6. Gotcha checklist

- **A pattern `switch` needs a `default` you don't want →** model the cases as a `sealed` type so the compiler proves exhaustiveness without one.
- **`null` leaked deep into the code →** wrap at the boundary with `Optional.ofNullable` and return `Optional`; don't pass `null` around.
- **`Optional` as a field or parameter feels wrong →** it is; `Optional` is for return values — use a nullable field or a real default instead.
- **A "modified" record didn't change →** records are immutable; `translate`-style methods return a *new* record; capture the result.
- **Reached for `var` and the type got unclear →** use `var` only when the initializer makes the type obvious; spell it out otherwise.

🧪 **Predict, then check.** Add a `Pentagon(double side)` to the §1 `Shape` hierarchy and predict what the compiler says about `area` until you add its case. Next, predict the three lines printed by §2 if `config` also contained `"port" -> "abc"` and you parsed it with `.map(Integer::parseInt)` — would `orElse(80)` save you? Finally, extend §4 to also print the *count* of `Card` payments using a stream `filter` with a pattern (`p instanceof Card`), and predict the result.
