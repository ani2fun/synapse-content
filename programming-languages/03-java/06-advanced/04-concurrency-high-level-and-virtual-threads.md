title: "Concurrency: High-Level & Virtual Threads"
summary: Raw threads and synchronized are low-level; java.util.concurrent gives you thread pools (ExecutorService) that return results via Future, lock-free atomics that fix races without locking, CompletableFuture for composing async work, and concurrent collections. Virtual threads (JDK 21) make blocking nearly free, so you can run millions. Every behavior shown with verified output, including 10,000 virtual threads finishing in a fraction of a second.

# Concurrency: High-Level & Virtual Threads

The last two chapters showed the raw material: [threads, races, and `synchronized`](/synapse/programming-languages/java/advanced/concurrency-the-basics), then [waiting, multiple locks, and the synchronizers](/synapse/programming-languages/java/advanced/concurrency-coordination) — correct, but low-level and error-prone (manual lifecycle, manual locking, a real deadlock). The `java.util.concurrent` library packages those primitives so you mostly stop writing them: an **`ExecutorService`** manages a pool of threads you *submit* tasks to, handing back a **`Future`** for each result; **atomics** like `AtomicInteger` fix the counter race lock-free; **`CompletableFuture`** composes asynchronous steps into pipelines; and **concurrent collections** are safe to share. The headline JDK 21 feature, **virtual threads** (Project Loom), changes the economics entirely: a virtual thread is so cheap that blocking one costs almost nothing, so you can have *millions* — write simple blocking code and get massive scalability.

This is the deep pass of [concurrency basics](/synapse/programming-languages/java/advanced/concurrency-the-basics), using [lambdas](/synapse/programming-languages/java/robust-oop/nested-and-anonymous-classes-and-lambdas) as tasks. Every output below was produced by compiling and running the code (timings are illustrative and vary per machine).

> **How to read the Intuition boxes.** Each one is built in three moves: (1) the **mechanism** — what the compiler and the JVM are *actually doing*; (2) a **concrete bite** — a specific, runnable failure (often a real compiler error), shown so the trap is visible; (3) the **earned rule** — the decision heuristic, now justified rather than asserted, plus its cost.

## 1. `ExecutorService` and `Future`

Instead of creating `Thread`s by hand, you **submit** tasks to an `ExecutorService` (a managed thread pool). Each `submit` returns a `Future` — a handle to a result that may not exist yet; `get()` blocks until it does.

```java run
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        Future<Integer> f1 = pool.submit(() -> 6 * 7);
        Future<Integer> f2 = pool.submit(() -> 100 + 1);
        System.out.println(f1.get());
        System.out.println(f2.get());
        pool.shutdown();
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
42
101
```

```d2
direction: right

submit: "submit(task)" {
  shape: oval
}
queue: "task queue" {
  shape: rectangle
}
pool: "thread pool" {
  w1: "worker 1" { shape: rectangle }
  w2: "worker 2" { shape: rectangle }
}
result: "Future.get()\nreturns the result" {
  shape: rectangle
}

submit -> queue: "enqueue"
queue -> pool.w1: "dequeue + run"
queue -> pool.w2: "dequeue + run"
pool.w1 -> result: "completes"
```

**Analysis.** Two tasks (lambdas returning a value) were submitted to a pool of two threads; each `Future.get()` returned its task's result (`42`, `101`). We never created or started a `Thread` — the pool owns the threads and reuses them across tasks. The diagram shows the model: tasks queue up, idle workers pull and run them, and the `Future` is how you retrieve each result. `shutdown()` lets the pool finish and stop (without it, its non-daemon threads keep the JVM alive).

**Intuition.**
*Mechanism.* An `ExecutorService` holds a queue and a fixed set of worker threads that loop forever pulling tasks. `submit` enqueues a task and returns a `Future`; a worker runs it and stores the result in the `Future`, which `get()` blocks to retrieve. Thread *creation* (expensive) is decoupled from task *submission* (cheap).

*Concrete bite.* A task's exception isn't lost — it's captured and re-thrown by `get()`, wrapped in an `ExecutionException`:

```java run
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
        Future<Integer> f = pool.submit(() -> 10 / 0);
        System.out.println(f.get());
        pool.shutdown();
    }
}
```

**Output** *(a thrown exception):*
```
Exception in thread "main" java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
```

The task threw `ArithmeticException` on its worker thread; the `Future` stored it, and `get()` re-threw it wrapped in `ExecutionException` (call `getCause()` for the original). Unlike a raw `Thread`, where an uncaught exception just vanishes onto the console, a pool surfaces it to whoever awaits the result.

Shutdown itself has three distinct verbs, and production code uses all three. `shutdown()` stops *intake* but lets queued tasks finish; `shutdownNow()` additionally interrupts running tasks and returns the never-started ones; `awaitTermination(timeout)` is how the caller *waits* for the wind-down — none of them blocks by itself:

```java run
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
            int id = i;
            pool.submit(() -> {
                try { Thread.sleep(200); } catch (InterruptedException e) { return; }
                System.out.println("task " + id + " done");
            });
        }
        pool.shutdown();                     // stop accepting; queued tasks still run
        System.out.println("shutdown called: isShutdown=" + pool.isShutdown()
                + " isTerminated=" + pool.isTerminated());
        boolean finished = pool.awaitTermination(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        System.out.println("awaitTermination returned " + finished
                + ": isTerminated=" + pool.isTerminated());
    }
}
```

**Output** *(illustrative — task completion order varies; this is one real run):*
```
shutdown called: isShutdown=true isTerminated=false
task 1 done
task 2 done
task 4 done
task 3 done
awaitTermination returned true: isTerminated=true
```

`isShutdown` flipped immediately (intake closed), but `isTerminated` stayed `false` while the four queued tasks drained through two workers; only after `awaitTermination` observed the last task finish did it become `true`. The graceful-shutdown idiom is exactly this sequence — `shutdown()`, `awaitTermination(deadline)`, and only if the deadline passes, `shutdownNow()`.

*Earned rule.* Use an `ExecutorService` instead of raw `Thread`s — submit tasks, collect results via `Future`, and shut down deliberately: `shutdown()` → `awaitTermination` → `shutdownNow()` as the escalation path (or `try`-with-resources, since it's `AutoCloseable`, which does close-and-wait for you). Size fixed pools to roughly the core count for CPU-bound work; for workloads that mostly *block*, don't tune a bigger pool — use §4's virtual threads. The cost is owning the lifecycle and unwrapping `ExecutionException`; the benefit is pooled, reusable threads, queued tasks, and exceptions that propagate to the caller instead of disappearing.

## 2. Atomics and concurrent collections

The [counter race](/synapse/programming-languages/java/advanced/concurrency-the-basics) has a lock-free fix: `AtomicInteger`. Its `incrementAndGet()` performs read-modify-write as one indivisible hardware operation, so four threads incrementing it land on the correct total — no `synchronized` needed.

```java run
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class Main {
    static AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread[] threads = new Thread[4];
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            threads[i] = new Thread(() -> {
                for (int j = 0; j < 100000; j++) counter.incrementAndGet();
            });
            threads[i].start();
        }
        for (Thread t : threads) t.join();
        System.out.println(counter.get());
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
400000
```

**Analysis.** Always exactly 400,000, deterministically — the same workload that gave random sub-400,000 totals with a plain `int++` in the last chapter. `incrementAndGet()` is atomic: no two threads can interleave inside it, so no updates are lost, and it's faster than a lock because there's no blocking — the CPU does it with a single compare-and-swap instruction.

**Intuition.**
*Mechanism.* `AtomicInteger` wraps a value updated via hardware atomic instructions (compare-and-swap). Each operation is all-or-nothing and establishes happens-before, so it's both atomic *and* visible — without a lock, so threads don't block each other.

*Concrete bite.* Atomicity is per *operation*: `incrementAndGet()` is atomic, but combining two calls — `counter.set(counter.get() + 1)` — is *not* (another thread can change it between the `get` and the `set`), reintroducing the race. For a compound check-then-act, use `compareAndSet` or a lock. The same applies to collections: a `HashMap` shared across threads can corrupt; **`ConcurrentHashMap`** is the safe replacement (with atomic compound ops like `merge` and `computeIfAbsent`).

*Earned rule.* Use atomics (`AtomicInteger`/`AtomicLong`/`AtomicReference`) for single shared values and concurrent collections (`ConcurrentHashMap`) for shared maps, reserving `synchronized` for multi-step critical sections. The cost is that atomics only make *individual* operations atomic — compound logic still needs `compareAndSet` or a lock; the benefit is lock-free, non-blocking correctness for the common case of a single shared counter or reference.

---

## 3. `CompletableFuture`

A plain `Future` only lets you *block* for a result. **`CompletableFuture`** lets you *compose* asynchronous work: describe a pipeline of steps (`supplyAsync` → `thenApply` → …) that run as each predecessor completes, without blocking until the end.

```java run
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture
            .supplyAsync(() -> 21)
            .thenApply(n -> n * 2);
        System.out.println(future.get());
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
42
```

**Analysis.** `supplyAsync(() -> 21)` ran a task on a pool and produced `21`; `thenApply(n -> n * 2)` scheduled a *follow-up* that runs when the first completes, yielding `42`. The pipeline reads like a [stream](/synapse/programming-languages/java/advanced/functional-java-and-streams) but over *asynchronous* values — each stage is a callback wired to its predecessor's completion, so nothing blocks until the final `get()`.

The real power appears when the pipeline branches and rejoins. `thenCombine` **joins two independent** async results; `thenCompose` **chains a dependent** async call (the next call needs the previous result — and returns a `CompletableFuture` itself, which `thenCompose` flattens instead of nesting); `exceptionally` catches a failure anywhere upstream and substitutes a fallback. Here is a full composition, running:

```java run
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class Main {
    static CompletableFuture<String> fetchUser(int id) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "user-" + id);
    }
    static CompletableFuture<Integer> fetchScore(String label) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> label.length() * 10);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        CompletableFuture<String> name = fetchUser(7);
        CompletableFuture<String> plan = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "premium");

        CompletableFuture<String> pipeline = name
            .thenCombine(plan, (n, p) -> n + " (" + p + ")")      // join two independent results
            .thenCompose(label -> fetchScore(label)               // chain a dependent async call
                .thenApply(score -> label + " -> score " + score))
            .exceptionally(e -> "fallback: " + e.getCause().getMessage());

        System.out.println(pipeline.get());
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
user-7 (premium) -> score 160
```

  D --> E["thenApply<br/>format result"]
  A -. any failure .-> X["exceptionally<br/>fallback value"]
  C -. any failure .-> X
  D -. any failure .-> X
```

**Analysis.** The two `supplyAsync` calls started *concurrently* — neither waited for the other; `thenCombine` fired only when both were ready, and `thenCompose` then launched the score lookup that *needed* the combined label (`"user-7 (premium)"`, 16 characters, → 160). The diagram is the dependency graph the executor drives: work advances edge by edge as results arrive, and no thread ever sits blocked between stages. And when a stage fails, the error takes the dotted path instead:

```java run
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        CompletableFuture<String> pipeline = CompletableFuture
            .<String>supplyAsync(() -> { throw new IllegalStateException("service down"); })
            .thenApply(s -> s + "!")            // skipped — there is no value to transform
            .exceptionally(e -> "fallback: " + e.getCause().getMessage());

        System.out.println(pipeline.get());
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
fallback: service down
```

The `thenApply` stage never ran — a failed stage completes the future *exceptionally*, downstream value-stages are skipped, and the exception propagates along the chain until `exceptionally` converts it back into a value. Without that handler, the exception would surface at `get()` wrapped in `ExecutionException`, exactly like §1's `Future`.

**Intuition.**
*Mechanism.* A `CompletableFuture` represents a value that will be ready later, plus a graph of continuations. `thenApply`/`thenCompose`/`thenCombine` register callbacks that fire on completion; you build a dependency graph that the executor drives, rather than blocking thread-by-thread. Failures travel the same graph as values — every stage completes either *normally* or *exceptionally*, and each kind of edge skips the stages meant for the other.

*Concrete bite.* The classic type error: using `thenApply` where you meant `thenCompose`. `thenApply(label -> fetchScore(label))` yields a `CompletableFuture<CompletableFuture<Integer>>` — a future *of a future* — and the compiler will let you, leaving you to unwrap the nesting at `get()`. If the function you're applying itself returns a `CompletableFuture`, you want `thenCompose` (the same map-vs-flatMap distinction as [streams](/synapse/programming-languages/java/advanced/functional-java-and-streams) and `Optional`).

*Earned rule.* Use `CompletableFuture` to compose multiple asynchronous operations (call services, combine results) without blocking between them; a plain `Future.get()` is fine for a single result you immediately need. The cost is a richer API and careful exception handling (`exceptionally`/`handle`); the benefit is non-blocking pipelines that scale far better than a thread blocked at each step.

## 4. Virtual threads

A platform thread maps to an OS thread — heavyweight (~1 MB stack), so you can have only thousands. A **virtual thread** (JDK 21) is scheduled by the JVM onto a small pool of OS threads, and *unmounts* when it blocks — so blocking is nearly free and you can run **millions**. Here 10,000 virtual threads each sleep 10 ms:

```java run
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        AtomicInteger done = new AtomicInteger(0);
        try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                executor.submit(() -> {
                    try { Thread.sleep(10); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                    done.incrementAndGet();
                });
            }
        }
        System.out.println("completed: " + done.get());
    }
}
```

**Output** *(completed near-instantly — one real run finished in ~0.12 s total):*
```
completed: 10000
```

**Analysis.** Ten thousand threads, each blocking for 10 ms, all finished — and the whole program took a fraction of a second. With *platform* threads this would need 10,000 OS threads (likely failing) or a pool that serializes them into many seconds. Virtual threads make the blocking `Thread.sleep` cheap: each unmounts from its carrier OS thread while sleeping, so a handful of OS threads serve all 10,000. The `newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()` gives each task its own virtual thread, and the `try`-with-resources `close()` waits for them all.

The unmounting has one important exception on Java 21: **pinning**. A virtual thread that blocks *while inside a `synchronized` block or method* cannot unmount — it pins its carrier OS thread for the whole wait, quietly costing you the scalability you came for. The JVM will tell you where, if you ask (shown statically — this run needs the `-Djdk.tracePinnedThreads=full` JVM flag, which the sandbox can't pass):

```java
public class Main {
    static final Object lock = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread vt = Thread.ofVirtual().name("vt-1").start(() -> {
            synchronized (lock) {               // holding a monitor...
                try { Thread.sleep(100); }      // ...while blocking: pins the carrier
                catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            }
        });
        vt.join();
        System.out.println("done");
    }
}
```

**Output** *(real captured run on Java 21 with `-Djdk.tracePinnedThreads=full`; trace trimmed):*
```
VirtualThread[#20,vt-1]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 reason:MONITOR
    java.base/java.lang.Thread.sleep(Thread.java:507)
    Main.lambda$main$0(Main.java:7) <== monitors:1
    java.base/java.lang.VirtualThread.run(VirtualThread.java:329)
done
```

The `reason:MONITOR` line is the JVM reporting the pin, and `<== monitors:1` points at the exact frame holding one. The fixes: keep blocking calls out of `synchronized` sections, or guard them with a `ReentrantLock` from the [coordination chapter](/synapse/programming-languages/java/advanced/concurrency-coordination), which virtual threads *can* unmount under. (This is a "Java 21 as deployed today" cost: JDK 24 — JEP 491 — reimplements monitors so `synchronized` no longer pins in most cases. Until you run there, treat monitor-plus-blocking as a pin.)

**Intuition.**
*Mechanism.* A virtual thread runs on a carrier OS thread only while executing; the moment it blocks (I/O, `sleep`, a lock), the JVM *unmounts* it and frees the carrier for another virtual thread. Blocking parks a cheap object, not an expensive OS thread — so the thread count is limited by memory, not by the OS. Unmounting works by copying the virtual thread's stack aside — which is why holding a native frame or (on Java 21) a monitor prevents it.

*Concrete bite.* Virtual threads speed up **I/O-bound** and blocking workloads (each thread spends most of its time waiting), not **CPU-bound** ones — a million threads doing pure computation still share the same few cores and won't go faster. And the pinning trace above is the second bite: a legacy library that blocks inside `synchronized` can silently turn your million-thread design back into a "handful of carriers, all pinned" design. They're a scalability tool for "many concurrent blocking operations," not a speed-up for raw computation.

*Earned rule.* Use virtual threads (one per task, via `newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor`) for high-concurrency *blocking* workloads — servers handling thousands of requests, fan-out I/O — and write simple blocking code instead of callback chains. The cost is that they don't help CPU-bound work and, on Java 21, monitor-guarded blocking pins the carrier (check with `-Djdk.tracePinnedThreads`); the benefit is enormous: "thread-per-request" blocking code that scales to millions of concurrent tasks on a handful of cores.

One outlook, because you'll meet it in code review before long: **structured concurrency** (`StructuredTaskScope`, a *preview* API in Java 21 — it needs `--enable-preview`, so no Run button here) makes a scope own its forked subtasks the way a `try` block owns a resource:

```java
try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
    var user  = scope.fork(() -> fetchUser());     // both run concurrently,
    var score = scope.fork(() -> fetchScore());    // on virtual threads
    scope.join().throwIfFailed();                  // wait; propagate any failure
    System.out.println(user.get() + ": " + score.get());
}
```

If either subtask fails, the scope cancels the other and the error surfaces at `join()` — concurrent work that starts together, ends together, and can't leak a runaway thread. It's the same idea Python ships as `asyncio.TaskGroup`; the shape is worth recognizing even before the API finalizes.

## 5. Mental-model summary

| Principle | Consequence |
|---|---|
| An `ExecutorService` pools threads; `submit` returns a `Future` | Reuse threads, queue tasks, retrieve results; `get()` re-throws task exceptions wrapped |
| `AtomicInteger` makes a single update atomic, lock-free | Fixes the counter race without `synchronized`; compound ops still need care |
| `CompletableFuture` composes async steps without blocking | A pipeline of continuations beats a chain of blocking `get()`s |
| Executor shutdown is three verbs: `shutdown` / `awaitTermination` / `shutdownNow` | Close intake, wait with a deadline, then escalate — none blocks by itself |
| A virtual thread unmounts when it blocks | Blocking is cheap — run millions; ideal for I/O-bound concurrency |
| On Java 21, blocking inside `synchronized` pins the carrier | Use `ReentrantLock` around blocking calls; trace pins with `-Djdk.tracePinnedThreads` |
| Virtual threads don't speed CPU-bound work | They scale *waiting*, not computation; cores still bound throughput |

## 6. Gotcha checklist

- **The program won't exit after submitting tasks →** you didn't `shutdown()` the executor; its non-daemon threads keep the JVM alive (use `try`-with-resources).
- **A submitted task's exception "disappeared" →** it's stored in the `Future`; `get()` throws `ExecutionException` — unwrap with `getCause()`.
- **An atomic counter is still wrong →** you combined two atomic calls (`set(get()+1)`); use `incrementAndGet`/`compareAndSet`, or a lock for multi-step logic.
- **A shared `HashMap` corrupted under threads →** use `ConcurrentHashMap` (with `merge`/`computeIfAbsent` for atomic compound updates).
- **Virtual threads didn't speed up CPU-bound work →** they scale blocking, not computation; for CPU work, size a pool to the cores.
- **`thenApply` gave you a `CompletableFuture<CompletableFuture<…>>` →** the function itself returns a future; use `thenCompose` to flatten the chain.
- **Virtual threads scaled worse than promised →** something blocks inside `synchronized` and pins its carrier (Java 21); find it with `-Djdk.tracePinnedThreads=full`, fix with `ReentrantLock` or by moving the blocking call out.

---

*Predict, then check.* Predict the two lines printed by submitting `() -> "a".repeat(3)` and `() -> 2 + 2` to a pool and printing each `Future.get()`. Next, predict whether `AtomicInteger` incremented 100,000 times by 5 threads prints exactly `500000`, and why. Finally, explain why 100,000 virtual threads each doing `Thread.sleep(100)` finish in roughly 100 ms, while 100,000 platform threads could not — in terms of mounting and unmounting.
