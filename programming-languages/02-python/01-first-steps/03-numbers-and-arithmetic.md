title: Numbers & Arithmetic
summary: Python's arithmetic mostly matches school maths, but a handful of rules — true vs floor division, the remainder, exponent precedence, and binary floating-point — decide the result. Learn them and you can predict any expression's value before running it.

# Numbers & Arithmetic — Predicting the Result

Python does arithmetic the way you'd expect from school — mostly. The thesis of this chapter is the "mostly": **a few specific rules — the two kinds of division, operator precedence, and how decimals are stored — explain every arithmetic result that looks surprising.** Learn those rules and you can predict what any expression evaluates to before you run it, which is exactly the skill that prevents silent wrong answers later.

Every output below was produced by running the code. As you read, change the numbers and predict the new result before clicking Run.

> **How to read the Intuition boxes.** Each one is built in three moves: (1) the **mechanism** — what the interpreter is *actually doing*; (2) a **concrete bite** — a specific, runnable way the naive assumption fails; (3) the **earned rule** — the decision heuristic, now justified rather than asserted, plus its cost.

## 1. The four basic operators

Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are written `+`, `-`, `*`, and division is `/`. They work on the `int` and `float` numbers from the last chapter.

```python run
print(7 + 3)
print(7 - 3)
print(7 * 3)
print(7 / 3)
```

**Output:**
```
10
4
21
2.3333333333333335
```

**Analysis.** The first three are unsurprising: `10`, `4`, `21`, all whole numbers. The fourth, `7 / 3`, is `2.3333333333333335` — a decimal. Division produced a `float` even though we divided two `int`s, and the long tail of digits is a preview of §5.

**Intuition.**
*Mechanism.* `/` is **true division**: it always produces a `float`, because the mathematically correct answer to "a divided by b" is generally not a whole number, and Python picks the type that can represent fractions.

*Concrete bite.* This holds even when the division comes out even:

```python run
print(6 / 2)         # not 3 — it is 3.0
print(type(6 / 2))
```
```
3.0
<class 'float'>
```

`6 / 2` is `3.0`, a `float`, not `3` the `int` — the result type is decided by the *operator*, not by whether the answer happens to be whole.

*Earned rule.* `+`, `-`, `*` keep `int`s as `int`s, but `/` always gives a `float`. The cost surfaces later: some operations (like picking an item at a position) demand an `int` and reject `3.0`, so when you want whole-number division you need a different operator — the next section's `//`.

---

## 2. Integer division and remainder

Two operators handle whole-number division. `//` (floor division) gives the whole-number part of a division; `%` (modulo) gives the remainder left over. Together they answer "how many whole times does b fit into a, and what's left?"

```python run
print(17 // 5)    # how many whole 5s fit in 17
print(17 % 5)     # what is left over
```

**Output:**
```
3
2
```

**Analysis.** Five fits into seventeen three whole times (`17 // 5` is `3`), with two left over (`17 % 5` is `2`). Check: `3 * 5 + 2 == 17`. These two operators are how you test "is this number even?" (`n % 2`), wrap values around a range, or split a total into groups.

**Intuition.**
*Mechanism.* `//` doesn't "chop off the decimal" — it **floors**, meaning it rounds *down* toward negative infinity to the nearest whole number. For positive results, flooring and chopping look identical, which hides the difference.

*Concrete bite.* Make the result negative and the two ideas part ways:

```python run
print(7 // 2)     # 3, as expected
print(-7 // 2)    # NOT -3 — it rounds down to -4
```
```
3
-4
```

`7 // 2` is `3` (chopping and flooring agree). But `-7 // 2` is `-4`, not `-3`: true division gives `-3.5`, and flooring rounds *down* to `-4`. "Chopping the decimal" would have given `-3` — the wrong answer. The remainder follows the same rule, so `%` with negatives can surprise too: `-7 % 2` is `1`, not `-1`.

*Earned rule.* Use `//` for whole-number division and `%` for remainders, but remember `//` floors toward −∞ — for negative numbers it is *not* the same as discarding the decimal. The cost of forgetting is an off-by-one bug that only appears once a value goes negative, which is exactly when it's hardest to notice.

## 3. Exponentiation

Raising a number to a power is `**` (two asterisks). `2 ** 10` is "2 to the power 10." A fractional exponent gives roots: `x ** 0.5` is the square root of `x`.

```python run
print(2 ** 10)    # 2 to the power of 10
print(2 ** 0.5)   # a fractional exponent: the square root of 2
```

**Output:**
```
1024
1.4142135623730951
```

**Analysis.** `2 ** 10` is `1024` (an `int`, since both operands are `int`s and the result is whole). `2 ** 0.5` is `1.4142135623730951` — the square root of 2, a `float` because the exponent is a `float`.

**Intuition.**
*Mechanism.* `**` binds **more tightly** than the other arithmetic operators — and, surprisingly, more tightly than a leading minus sign. So Python applies the power *before* it applies a negation in front of it.

*Concrete bite.* That precedence makes a negative-looking expression come out negative:

```python run
print(-2 ** 2)    # is this 4, or -4?
```
```
-4
```

You might read `-2 ** 2` as "(−2) squared = 4." Python reads it as `-(2 ** 2)` = `-(4)` = `-4`, because `**` runs before the minus. To square negative two, you must group it: `(-2) ** 2` gives `4`.

*Earned rule.* `**` is exponentiation and has very high precedence — higher than unary minus — so parenthesise when a negative base is involved. The cost of the default is silent sign errors: `-2 ** 2` gives a perfectly valid number, just not the one you meant, so nothing flags the mistake.

---

## 4. Precedence and parentheses

When several operators appear in one expression, Python applies them in a fixed **precedence** order — the same "times before plus" rule as school maths: `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` bind tighter than `+` and `-`. Parentheses override the order.

```python run
print(2 + 3 * 4)      # multiplication happens before addition
print((2 + 3) * 4)    # parentheses force the addition first
```

**Output:**
```
14
20
```

**Analysis.** `2 + 3 * 4` is `14`: `3 * 4` happens first (`12`), then `+ 2`. Add parentheses — `(2 + 3) * 4` — and the addition goes first (`5`), then `* 4`, giving `20`. Same numbers, same operators, different grouping, different answer.

**Intuition.**
*Mechanism.* Python evaluates higher-precedence operators before lower ones regardless of left-to-right reading order, and parentheses force a sub-expression to be computed first.

*Concrete bite.* Precedence quietly ruins a hand-written average:

```python run
print(1 + 2 + 3 / 3)      # not 2 — the division happens first
print((1 + 2 + 3) / 3)    # the average you actually meant
```
```
4.0
2.0
```

`1 + 2 + 3 / 3` looks like "average of 1, 2, 3 = 2," but `/` binds tighter than `+`, so Python computes `3 / 3 = 1.0` first, then `1 + 2 + 1.0 = 4.0`. The average you intended needs parentheses around the sum: `(1 + 2 + 3) / 3` is `2.0`.

*Earned rule.* Memorise the core order — `**` first, then `* / // %`, then `+ -` — but **parenthesise anything non-obvious** rather than trusting the reader (often future-you) to recall it. The cost of getting precedence wrong is the worst kind: no error at all, just a confidently wrong number.

## 5. Integers, floats, and the precision trap

`int`s are exact whole numbers of any size. `float`s represent numbers with a decimal point — but they store them in **binary**, and most decimal fractions have no exact binary form, so a `float` is often a very close *approximation*, not the exact value.

```python run
print(10 / 3)
print(10 // 3)
```

**Output:**
```
3.3333333333333335
3
```

**Analysis.** `10 / 3` is a `float` approximation of one-third-times-ten, accurate to ~16 digits — note it even ends in `...35`, not an endless run of 3s, because that's the closest value the binary `float` can hold. `10 // 3` sidesteps fractions entirely and gives the exact `int` `3`.

**Intuition.**
*Mechanism.* A `float` is stored as the nearest representable binary fraction. For values like `0.1` that have no exact binary form, "nearest" means *slightly off*, and those tiny errors can add up visibly.

*Concrete bite.* The most famous example in all of programming:

```python run
total = 0.1 + 0.2
print(total)              # not exactly 0.3
```
```
0.30000000000000004
```

`0.1` and `0.2` are each stored a hair off, and their errors combine to `0.30000000000000004` — not `0.3`. This is not a Python bug; it's how binary floating-point works in every mainstream language. The fix when you need a clean decimal is to **round** to the precision you care about (`round(value, ndigits)`):

```python run
total = 0.1 + 0.2
print(round(total, 2))    # 0.3, rounded to 2 decimal places
```
```
0.3
```

*Earned rule.* Treat `float` results as accurate-but-approximate: round for display, and never assume two floats are *exactly* equal (a trap you'll meet head-on with `==` in [Tutorial 6](/synapse/programming-languages/python/control-flow/booleans-and-logic)). The cost of the approximation is the whole reason it exists — floats trade exactness for the ability to represent a vast range of magnitudes efficiently; when you need exact decimals (money, especially), work in integer units like cents, or reach for the `decimal` module much later.

## 6. Mental-model summary

| Principle | Consequence |
|---|---|
| `/` is true division — always a `float` | `6 / 2` is `3.0`, not `3`; use `//` for a whole-number result |
| `//` floors toward −∞; `%` is the remainder | `-7 // 2` is `-4` (not `-3`); `-7 % 2` is `1` |
| `**` is exponentiation with very high precedence | `-2 ** 2` is `-4`; write `(-2) ** 2` for `4` |
| Operators follow precedence: `**` → `* / // %` → `+ -` | `1 + 2 + 3 / 3` is `4.0`; parenthesise to force order |
| `float`s are binary approximations of decimals | `0.1 + 0.2` is `0.30000000000000004`; round for display |

## 7. Gotcha checklist

- **Got a `float` where you wanted a whole number →** you used `/`; switch to `//` for floor division.
- **Negative `//` or `%` looks off by one →** `//` floors toward −∞; for `-7 // 2` that's `-4`, by design.
- **`-x ** 2` came out negative →** `**` binds tighter than the minus; write `(-x) ** 2`.
- **A formula gives the wrong number with no error →** precedence bit you; add parentheses around the part that must go first.
- **`0.1 + 0.2` isn't `0.3` / decimals look slightly wrong →** binary float approximation; `round(value, n)` for display, integer cents for money.

*Predict, then check.* Without running them, write down the value **and the type** of each: `9 / 3`, `9 // 2`, `-9 // 2`, `2 + 2 ** 3`, and `(0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1)`. Two of these have results that surprise most beginners — predict all five, then build a runnable block to check. Being able to do this reliably is the entire goal of the chapter.
