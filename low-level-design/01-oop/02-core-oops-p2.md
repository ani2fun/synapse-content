# Abstraction, Interfaces, Static Members & Inner Classes

## Abstraction

Abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the necessary features or interface to the user. In simpler terms, abstraction allows us to focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it.

Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces in languages like Java. It allows programmers to create a blueprint or template for objects without having to worry about their specific implementation details, making the system easier to use and manage.

### Key features of abstraction

- **Hiding implementation details:** The goal of abstraction is to hide the complex implementation details of a system and provide a simpler interface for interaction. For example, when you drive a car, you don't need to know how the engine works internally; you just need to know how to start the car, steer, and stop.
- **Abstract methods:** These are methods declared in abstract classes or interfaces but have no body (i.e., they have no implementation). The implementation must be provided by the subclass or the class that implements the interface.
- **Concrete methods:** These are methods with complete implementation in an abstract class. Subclasses inherit these methods, but they are also allowed to override them if necessary.

### Benefits of abstraction in programming

Abstraction allows the programmers to:

- **Simplify the system:** By hiding unnecessary details, it reduces complexity.
- **Improve maintainability:** It makes the code more manageable, as changes to implementation details don't affect the rest of the system.
- **Increase reusability:** It allows code to be reused across different parts of the system with different implementations.
- **Provide security:** It ensures that the user interacts with the system at a higher level, without the risk of them modifying or interacting with internal mechanisms directly.

💡 **Insight.** Abstraction is about *what* an object does, not *how* it does it — the driving-a-car analogy is exact: you learn the pedals and the wheel once, and that interface stays the same whether the engine underneath is a combustion engine or an electric motor.

</div>

In Java, abstraction can be implemented using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

### Abstract classes

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and must be inherited by a subclass. It can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).

Abstract methods are those that are declared but not implemented in the abstract class, leaving the actual implementation to be provided by the subclasses. Consider the following code snippet:

```java
import java.util.*;
// Abstract class
abstract class Animal {
    // Concrete method
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }

    // Abstract method (no implementation)
    abstract void sound();
}

// Concrete class that extends the abstract class
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Providing implementation for the abstract method
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    // Providing implementation for the abstract method
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("The cat meows.");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        Animal myCat = new Cat();

        myDog.eat();  // Inherited concrete method
        myDog.sound(); // Overridden method in Dog class

        myCat.eat();  // Inherited concrete method
        myCat.sound(); // Overridden method in Cat class
    }
}
```

**Explanation.**

- The `Animal` class is abstract and defines both an abstract method `sound()` (which has no body) and a concrete method `eat()` (which has a body).
- The `Dog` and `Cat` classes are concrete classes that extend the `Animal` class. They provide their own implementations for the abstract `sound()` method.
- When we create objects of `Dog` and `Cat`, we can call both the inherited concrete `eat()` method and the overridden `sound()` method.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Animal {
        <<abstract>>
        #name String
        +eat() void
        +sound() void
    }
    class Dog {
        +sound() void
    }
    class Cat {
        +sound() void
    }
    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat
```

### Interfaces

An interface is similar to an abstract class, but it can only contain abstract methods (until Java 8, after which default methods were introduced). All methods in an interface are implicitly abstract, and it is used to represent a contract that the implementing classes must fulfill.

Consider the following code snippet:

```java
import java.util.*;
// Interface
interface Animal {
    void sound(); // Abstract method
    void eat();   // Abstract method
}

// Implementing the interface in the Dog class
class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }

    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("The dog eats food.");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.eat();  // Implemented method
        myDog.sound(); // Implemented method
    }
}
```

**Explanation.**

- The `Animal` interface defines two abstract methods: `sound()` and `eat()`.
- The `Dog` class implements the `Animal` interface and provides concrete implementations for both methods.
- When we create an object of type `Dog`, we can call the `eat()` and `sound()` methods that were defined in the interface and implemented by the `Dog` class.

<div style="border-left:4px solid #15448e;background:rgba(21,68,142,0.08);padding:0.6rem 1rem;border-radius:0 0.5rem 0.5rem 0;margin:1.25rem 0">

📘 **Definition.** An abstract class can mix abstract and concrete methods and hold instance state (like `name` in the `Animal` example above); an interface is a pure contract — a class implements it with `implements` rather than extending it, and (pre-Java 8) every method was implicitly abstract.

</div>

### Static and default methods

**Static methods.** Static methods belong to the class rather than any instance of the class. This means that they can be called without creating an object of the class. Static methods can only directly access static members of the class, not instance variables or instance methods. They are defined using the `static` keyword.

```java
import java.util.*;
class Example {
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example.staticMethod();  // Accessing static method directly using the class name
    }
}
```

**Keypoints.**

- They are called on the class itself, not on an instance of the class.
- They can be used to perform operations that are common to all instances of a class.
- They can access only other static members (variables, methods) of the class.
- They cannot access instance variables or methods.

**Default methods.** Default methods were introduced in Java 8 to allow adding new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. Prior to Java 8, interfaces could only declare method signatures, leaving the implementation to the classes that implemented the interface. With the introduction of default methods, interfaces can now provide default implementations for methods.

```java
import java.util.*;
interface Example {
    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a default method.");
    }
}

class Demo implements Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Demo();
        obj.defaultMethod();  // Accessing default method
    }
}
```

**Keypoints.**

- Default methods have a body and are defined using the `default` keyword in the interface.
- They can be called on objects that implement the interface.
- They allow user to add new methods to an interface without affecting existing classes that implement the interface.
- If a class implements an interface with a default method, the class can override the method if needed.

**Why default methods were introduced.** Before Java 8, adding a new method to an interface would break all existing implementations of that interface. This was a limitation when you wanted to evolve libraries and APIs without breaking backward compatibility. To solve this, Java 8 introduced default methods, allowing interfaces to provide method implementations, ensuring existing classes can still work without modification.

**Use cases for default methods.**

- **Backward compatibility:** Allows the addition of new methods to interfaces without affecting existing classes that implement the interface.
- **Multiple interfaces:** In cases where a class implements multiple interfaces that may have the same method signature, a default method can be used to avoid conflicts by providing a default implementation.

### Common abstraction questions

**Can an abstract class extend another abstract class?**

Yes, an abstract class can extend another abstract class in Java. An abstract class can inherit from another abstract class just like a regular class would. The subclass (child abstract class) will inherit the abstract methods and behaviors of the parent class, but it is not required to implement the abstract methods from the parent class unless it is a concrete class (i.e., a class that is not abstract).

If the subclass is also abstract, it can either:

- Implement the abstract methods from the parent class, or
- Leave them unimplemented (in which case, the subclass must also be declared as abstract).

**Can an abstract class have a constructor and can we create an instance of it?**

No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly in Java. An abstract class is designed to be inherited by other classes, and it is not meant to be instantiated on its own.

However, an abstract class can have a constructor, which can be invoked by a subclass when an instance of the subclass is created. This allows the abstract class to initialize its fields before the subclass adds its own specific behaviors.

**Keypoints.**

- **Abstract class constructor:** An abstract class can have constructors, but you cannot create an instance of the abstract class directly. The constructor is only called when a subclass object is created.
- **Subclass constructor:** When a subclass is instantiated, its constructor can call the constructor of the abstract class using the `super()` keyword.

## Your Turn — Practice: Abstraction

Define an abstract `Animal` with an abstract `makeSound()`, then let `Dog` and `Cat` supply their own — runtime polymorphism through an abstract base.

````problem
Design an abstract class `Animal` and two concrete subclasses that override its abstract method.

**Abstract class `Animal`**

- Attribute: `name` (`String`).
- Abstract method: `makeSound()`.

**Subclasses**

- `Dog extends Animal` — `makeSound()` prints `The dog <name> says : Woof!`.
- `Cat extends Animal` — `makeSound()` prints `The cat <name> says : Meow!`.

**Input format.** Two lines on standard input: the dog's name, then the cat's name. The provided `Main` builds a `Dog` and a `Cat` (held as `Animal` references) and calls `makeSound()` on each, with a blank line between.

**Example 1** — Input: `Buddy`, `Whiskers`

```text
The dog Buddy says : Woof!

The cat Whiskers says : Meow!
```
````

```java run
import java.util.*;

abstract class Animal {
    protected String name;

    Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Abstract: no body here — each subclass MUST provide one.
    abstract void makeSound();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        // TODO: print "The dog <name> says : Woof!"
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    Cat(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        // TODO: print "The cat <name> says : Meow!"
    }
}

// The driver is complete — implement makeSound() in Dog and Cat above.
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String dName = sc.nextLine().trim();
        String cName = sc.nextLine().trim();

        Animal dog = new Dog(dName);
        dog.makeSound();

        System.out.println();

        Animal cat = new Cat(cName);
        cat.makeSound();
    }
}
```

```testcases
{
  "args": [
    { "id": "dogName", "label": "Dog name", "type": "string" },
    { "id": "catName", "label": "Cat name", "type": "string" }
  ],
  "cases": [
    { "args": { "dogName": "Buddy", "catName": "Whiskers" }, "expected": "The dog Buddy says : Woof!\n\nThe cat Whiskers says : Meow!" },
    { "args": { "dogName": "Rex", "catName": "Felix" }, "expected": "The dog Rex says : Woof!\n\nThe cat Felix says : Meow!" }
  ]
}
```

````editorial
`Animal` can't be instantiated — it declares `makeSound()` with no body, so it exists only to be extended. Each subclass supplies its own `makeSound()`, and because `Main` holds the objects through `Animal` references, the JVM picks the right override at runtime from each object's actual type (`Dog` or `Cat`). That late binding is **runtime polymorphism**; the abstract method is the contract guaranteeing every animal has a sound.

```java solution
import java.util.*;

abstract class Animal {
    protected String name;

    Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    abstract void makeSound();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("The dog " + name + " says : Woof!");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    Cat(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("The cat " + name + " says : Meow!");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String dName = sc.nextLine().trim();
        String cName = sc.nextLine().trim();

        Animal dog = new Dog(dName);
        dog.makeSound();

        System.out.println();

        Animal cat = new Cat(cName);
        cat.makeSound();
    }
}
```
````

## Interfaces

An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class that defines a contract for behavior but does not provide an implementation. It contains a set of abstract methods (methods without a body) that a class must implement if it chooses to "sign the contract" by implementing the interface. Think of it as a way to specify what a class should do without dictating how it should do it.

Consider the following code snippet:

```java
import java.util.*;
interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void sleep();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog eats bones.");
    }

    @Override
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Dog sleeps in a kennel.");
    }
}
```

Here, `Animal` is the interface, and `Dog` is a class implementing it by providing specific behaviors for `eat` and `sleep` methods.

### Interface fields and constructors

**Can an interface have instance variables?**

No, an interface cannot have instance variables. All fields in an interface are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`. This means they act as constants and cannot be changed. Attempting to declare a non-static or non-final field will result in a compilation error.

<div style="border-left:4px solid #da5233;background:rgba(218,82,51,0.08);padding:0.6rem 1rem;border-radius:0 0.5rem 0.5rem 0;margin:1.25rem 0">

⚠️ **Watch out.** Every field you declare in an interface is silently `public static final`, whether you write those modifiers or not. There's no such thing as per-instance state in an interface — if a design needs mutable fields, that belongs in the implementing class or in an abstract class instead.

</div>

**Can interfaces have constructors?**

No, interfaces cannot have constructors. This is because constructors are used to initialize the state of an object, and interfaces cannot have state (no instance variables). Since interfaces are not classes and cannot be instantiated directly, they do not need constructors.

However, a class that implements an interface can have its own constructors to initialize its objects. For example:

```java
import java.util.*;
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    private String brand;

    Car(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println(brand + " car is starting.");
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `Car` class provides a constructor for initialization, but the `Vehicle` interface does not.

### Multiple interface implementation

**Can a class implement multiple interfaces?**

Yes, a class in Java can implement multiple interfaces. This is one of the key advantages of using interfaces because Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes, but it does with interfaces. For example:

```java
import java.util.*;
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

interface Swimmable {
    void swim();
}

class Duck implements Flyable, Swimmable {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Duck is flying.");
    }

    @Override
    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("Duck is swimming.");
    }
}
```

Here, the `Duck` class implements both `Flyable` and `Swimmable` interfaces, providing specific behaviors for flying and swimming.

### Key features of interfaces

Interfaces are powerful because they enable several key benefits:

- **Multiple inheritance:** As mentioned earlier, a class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for functionality from various sources to be combined.
- **Contracts:** An interface acts as a contract that a class must fulfill. This ensures consistency across different classes implementing the interface.
- **Loosely coupled systems:** By programming to an interface rather than a concrete class, your code becomes more flexible and easier to maintain.

To better understand, consider the given code snippet:

```java
import java.util.*;
interface PaymentGateway {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

class PayPal implements PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing payment via PayPal: $" + amount);
    }
}

class Stripe implements PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing payment via Stripe: $" + amount);
    }
}
```

Here, a client can use any implementation of `PaymentGateway` (e.g., `PayPal` or `Stripe`) without being tightly coupled to a specific one.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PaymentGateway {
        <<interface>>
        +processPayment(amount) void
    }
    class CreditCardPayment {
        +processPayment(amount) void
    }
    class UPIPayment {
        +processPayment(amount) void
    }
    PaymentGateway <|.. CreditCardPayment
    PaymentGateway <|.. UPIPayment
```

<div style="border-left:4px solid #195045;background:rgba(25,80,69,0.08);padding:0.6rem 1rem;border-radius:0 0.5rem 0.5rem 0;margin:1.25rem 0">

💡 **Insight.** This is polymorphism through an interface: the caller only ever talks to `PaymentGateway`, and which concrete class runs — `CreditCardPayment` or `UPIPayment` — is decided at runtime by whatever object was assigned. The caller's code never has to change when a new payment method is added.

</div>

### Default and static methods in interfaces

**Static methods in interfaces.** Static methods in interfaces belong to the interface itself rather than any instance of a class that implements the interface. This means that they can be called directly using the interface name without creating an object of the implementing class. Static methods in interfaces can only access other static members of the interface, not instance variables or instance methods. They are defined using the `static` keyword.

```java
import java.util.*;

interface Example {
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method in an interface.");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example.staticMethod(); // Accessing static method directly using the interface name
    }
}
```

**Keypoints.**

- They are called on the interface itself, not on an instance of a class implementing the interface.
- They can be used to perform operations that are related to the interface itself, not the implementing class.
- They can only access other static members (variables, methods) of the interface.
- They cannot access instance variables or instance methods of the implementing class.

**Default methods in interfaces.** Default methods were introduced in Java 8 to allow adding new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. Prior to Java 8, interfaces could only declare method signatures, leaving the implementation to the classes that implemented the interface. With the introduction of default methods, interfaces can now provide default implementations for methods.

```java
import java.util.*;
interface Example {
    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a default method.");
    }
}

class Demo implements Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Demo();
        obj.defaultMethod();  // Accessing default method
    }
}
```

**Keypoints.**

- Default methods have a body and are defined using the `default` keyword in the interface.
- They can be called on objects that implement the interface.
- They allow user to add new methods to an interface without affecting existing classes that implement the interface.
- If a class implements an interface with a default method, the class can override the method if needed.

**Why default methods were introduced.** Before Java 8, adding a new method to an interface would break all existing implementations of that interface. This was a limitation when you wanted to evolve libraries and APIs without breaking backward compatibility. To solve this, Java 8 introduced default methods, allowing interfaces to provide method implementations, ensuring existing classes can still work without modification.

**Use cases for default methods.**

- **Backward compatibility:** Allows the addition of new methods to interfaces without affecting existing classes that implement the interface.
- **Multiple interfaces:** In cases where a class implements multiple interfaces that may have the same method signature, a default method can be used to avoid conflicts by providing a default implementation.

### Interface inheritance

Interfaces in Java can extend other interfaces, allowing for inheritance. When an interface inherits another, it can add new methods to the contract defined by the parent interface.

Consider the following code snippet:

```java
import java.util.*;
interface Animal {
    void eat();
}

interface Mammal extends Animal {
    void walk();
}

class Human implements Mammal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Human eats food.");
    }

    @Override
    public void walk() {
        System.out.println("Human walks on two legs.");
    }
}
```

Here, the `Mammal` interface inherits the `eat` method from `Animal` and adds the `walk` method. The `Human` class implements both methods.

## Your Turn — Practice: Interfaces

One `PaymentGateway` contract, two implementations. The driver processes each payment through the interface type without caring which concrete class it is — that's the point of programming to an interface.

````problem
Design an interface `PaymentGateway` with a single method, and two classes that implement it differently.

**Interface `PaymentGateway`**

- `processPayment(double amount)`.

**Implementations**

- `CreditCardPayment` — prints `Processing credit card payment of <amount>`.
- `UPIPayment` — prints `Processing UPI payment of <amount>`.

Print each amount to **two decimal places**.

**Input format.** Two lines on standard input: a comma-separated list of methods (`credit` or `upi`), and a comma-separated list of amounts (positionally matched). The provided `Main` picks the right implementation per method and calls `processPayment`, with a blank line between payments.

**Example 1** — methods `credit, upi` · amounts `284.5, 27476.2`

```text
Processing credit card payment of 284.50

Processing UPI payment of 27476.20
```
````

```java run
import java.util.*;

interface PaymentGateway {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // TODO: print "Processing credit card payment of <amount>" (2 decimals)
    }
}

class UPIPayment implements PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // TODO: print "Processing UPI payment of <amount>" (2 decimals)
    }
}

// The driver parses stdin and dispatches by method — implement the two classes above.
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String[] methods = sc.nextLine().split(",");
        String[] amounts = sc.nextLine().split(",");

        boolean first = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < methods.length; i++) {
            String m = methods[i].trim();
            PaymentGateway gateway;
            if (m.equals("credit")) gateway = new CreditCardPayment();
            else if (m.equals("upi")) gateway = new UPIPayment();
            else continue;
            if (!first) System.out.println();
            first = false;
            gateway.processPayment(Double.parseDouble(amounts[i].trim()));
        }
    }
}
```

```testcases
{
  "args": [
    { "id": "methods", "label": "Methods (comma-separated)", "type": "string" },
    { "id": "amounts", "label": "Amounts (comma-separated)", "type": "string" }
  ],
  "cases": [
    { "args": { "methods": "credit,upi", "amounts": "284.5,27476.2" }, "expected": "Processing credit card payment of 284.50\n\nProcessing UPI payment of 27476.20" },
    { "args": { "methods": "upi,credit", "amounts": "100,50" }, "expected": "Processing UPI payment of 100.00\n\nProcessing credit card payment of 50.00" }
  ]
}
```

````editorial
`PaymentGateway` is a pure contract — a method signature and nothing else. `CreditCardPayment` and `UPIPayment` each `implement` it their own way, and the driver holds every payment as a `PaymentGateway`, so adding a third method (say `WalletPayment`) later would need zero changes to the loop. `Locale.US` keeps the decimal separator a dot regardless of the machine's locale.

```java solution
import java.util.*;

interface PaymentGateway {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.printf(Locale.US, "Processing credit card payment of %.2f\n", amount);
    }
}

class UPIPayment implements PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.printf(Locale.US, "Processing UPI payment of %.2f\n", amount);
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String[] methods = sc.nextLine().split(",");
        String[] amounts = sc.nextLine().split(",");

        boolean first = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < methods.length; i++) {
            String m = methods[i].trim();
            PaymentGateway gateway;
            if (m.equals("credit")) gateway = new CreditCardPayment();
            else if (m.equals("upi")) gateway = new UPIPayment();
            else continue;
            if (!first) System.out.println();
            first = false;
            gateway.processPayment(Double.parseDouble(amounts[i].trim()));
        }
    }
}

## The static keyword

In Java, the `static` keyword is used to indicate that a member belongs to the class rather than to any specific instance of the class. It can be applied to variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes. Members marked as static are shared across all instances of the class, meaning they are loaded only once in memory during the class's lifecycle.

### Static variables

Static variables, also known as class variables, are shared by all instances of a class. They are declared with the `static` keyword and are initialized only once when the class is loaded into memory. They are useful for storing common values or constants that are the same for all objects.

To better understand, consider the following example:

```java
import java.util.*;

// Counter class
class Counter {
    static int count = 0; // static variable

    // Constructor
    Counter() {
        count++;
    }

    // Method to display count
    static void displayCount() {
        System.out.println("Count: " + count);
    }
}

// Main class
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter c1 = new Counter();
        Counter c2 = new Counter();
        Counter.displayCount(); // Output: Count: 2
    }
}
```

Here, the `count` variable is shared among all objects of the `Counter` class giving the output as 2 instead of 0.

### Static methods

Static methods belong to the class rather than to any instance. They can be called without creating an object of the class. These methods are commonly used for utility or helper functions like mathematical calculations.

To better understand, consider the following example:

```java
import java.util.*;

// Math Utility class
class MathUtils {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Calling static method without object creation
        int result = MathUtils.add(5, 3);

        System.out.println("Result: " + result); // Output: Result: 8
    }
}
```

Here, the program was able to call the `add` utility function without creating an object (instance) of the class because it is a static method.

**Keypoints.**

- Static methods cannot access non-static members (variables or methods) directly because non-static members require an instance of the class.
- Static methods can only directly call other static methods and access static variables.

### Static blocks

Static blocks, also known as static initialization blocks, are used to initialize static variables. They are executed when the class is loaded into memory, before any objects are created or static methods are called.

Consider the following code snippet:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Example {
    static int value;

    // Static block
    static {
        value = 10; // Initialization of static variable
        System.out.println("Static block executed.");
    }
}

// Main class
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Value: " + Example.value);
        // Output: Static block executed. Value: 10
    }
}
```

Static blocks are executed in the order they appear in the class.

### Interaction between static and non-static members

Static methods cannot directly access or invoke non-static methods or variables because static methods do not depend on a class instance. However, non-static members can be accessed indirectly by creating an instance of the class.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Example {
    int instanceVar = 10;

    static void staticMethod() {
        // Creating an instance to access non-static members
        Example obj = new Example();

        System.out.println("Instance variable: " + obj.instanceVar);
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example.staticMethod();
    }
}
```

In the above example, the static method `staticMethod` uses an object to access the non-static `instanceVar`.

### Advantages of static members in Java

There are several benefits of using static members:

- **Memory efficiency:** Static variables are loaded into memory only once, reducing memory usage.
- **Utility functions:** Static methods are ideal for utility or helper methods that do not require object-specific data (e.g., `Math.sqrt()`).
- **Initialization:** Static blocks allow for the initialization of static variables, ensuring that common resources are ready for use.

Consider the following code snippet:

```java
import java.util.*;

// Utility Class
class Utils {
    static void printMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Utils.printMessage("Hello, Static!"); // Output: Hello, Static!
    }
}
```

As you can see, static members simplify scenarios where sharing resources or creating reusable methods is required.

<div style="border-left:4px solid #195045;background:rgba(25,80,69,0.08);padding:0.6rem 1rem;border-radius:0 0.5rem 0.5rem 0;margin:1.25rem 0">

💡 **Insight.** Every static member — variable, method, or block — lives on the class, not on any object of it. That's why `count` in the `Counter` example is shared across every instance, and why a static method can't reach an instance field unless it first creates (or is handed) an object to read it from.

</div>

## Your Turn — Practice: Static Keyword

Track how many `Counter` objects exist using a single `static` field shared across every instance — the defining trait of static state.

````problem
Design a class `Counter` that counts how many of its objects have been created, using a `static` variable shared by all instances.

**Attribute**

- `count` (`static int`) — the total number of objects created.

**Methods**

- A no-arg constructor that increments `count` on each instantiation.
- `static int getCount()` — returns the current count.
- `static void resetCount()` — resets `count` to 0.

**Input format.** One line on standard input: how many `Counter` objects to create. The provided `Main` instantiates that many, prints `getCount()`, then calls `resetCount()`.

**Example 1** — Input: `10`

```text
Number of objects created : 10
```

**Constraints:** 1 ≤ count ≤ 10⁵
````

```java run
import java.util.*;

class Counter {
    // TODO: a STATIC counter shared by every instance (starts at 0)

    public Counter() {
        // TODO: increment the shared count
    }

    public static int getCount() {
        // TODO: return the count
        return 0;
    }

    public static void resetCount() {
        // TODO: reset the count to 0
    }
}

// The driver is complete — implement Counter above.
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int count = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine().trim());

        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            new Counter();
        }

        System.out.println("Number of objects created : " + Counter.getCount());
        Counter.resetCount();
    }
}
```

```testcases
{
  "args": [
    { "id": "count", "label": "Objects to create", "type": "int" }
  ],
  "cases": [
    { "args": { "count": "10" }, "expected": "Number of objects created : 10" },
    { "args": { "count": "5" }, "expected": "Number of objects created : 5" }
  ]
}
```

````editorial
Because `count` is `static`, there is exactly **one** copy of it — owned by the class, not by any object — so every `new Counter()` increments the same variable. `getCount` and `resetCount` are `static` too: they read that class-level state without needing an instance, which is why `Main` calls them as `Counter.getCount()` rather than on an object. (Each Run is a fresh JVM, so the count always starts at 0.)

```java solution
import java.util.*;

class Counter {
    private static int count = 0;

    public Counter() {
        count++;
    }

    public static int getCount() {
        return count;
    }

    public static void resetCount() {
        count = 0;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int count = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine().trim());

        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            new Counter();
        }

        System.out.println("Number of objects created : " + Counter.getCount());
        Counter.resetCount();
    }
}
```
````

## Inner classes

Inner classes are classes that are defined within another class. They are a powerful feature in Java that allows you to logically group classes that are only used in one place, making the code more readable and encapsulated. They have direct access to all the members (both static and non-static) of the outer class.

Java provides several types of inner classes to suit different use cases:

- Static Nested Classes
- Non-Static Inner Classes
- Local Inner Classes
- Anonymous Inner Classes

```d2
OuterClass: "OuterClass" {
  StaticNestedClass: "Static Nested Class\nno outer instance needed" { shape: rectangle }
  InnerClass: "Non-static Inner Class\nholds implicit outer reference" { shape: rectangle }
  LocalInnerClass: "Local Inner Class\nscoped to a method" { shape: rectangle }
  AnonymousInnerClass: "Anonymous Inner Class\nno name, one-time use" { shape: rectangle }
}
```

### Static nested classes

A static nested class is defined with the `static` modifier. Since it is static, it does not require an instance of the outer class to be created. Static nested classes can only access the static members of the outer class.

Consider the code snippet:

```java
import java.util.*;

class OuterClass {
    static int staticVar = 100;

    // Static Nested Class
    static class StaticNestedClass {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Static variable: " + staticVar);
        }
    }
}

// Main class
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nestedObj =
            new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();

        nestedObj.display(); // Output: Static variable: 100
    }
}
```

Here, the `StaticNestedClass` can access the `OuterClass`'s static members directly without requiring an instance of the outer class.

**Keypoints.**

- Declared using the `static` keyword.
- Can only access the static members of the outer class.
- No reference to an outer class instance is maintained.

Static nested classes are often used to group classes that are tightly related and do not need access to instance-specific data.

### Non-static inner classes

A non-static inner class is associated with an instance of the outer class. It has access to all members (both static and non-static) of the outer class, including private members.

Consider the given code snippet:

```java
import java.util.*;

class OuterClass {
    int instanceVar = 42;

    // Non-static Nested Inner class
    class InnerClass {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Instance variable: " + instanceVar);
        }
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass outerObj = new OuterClass();
        OuterClass.InnerClass innerObj = outerObj.new InnerClass();
        innerObj.display(); // Output: Instance variable: 42
    }
}
```

In the example, the `InnerClass` can access `instanceVar` directly because it is tied to an instance of `OuterClass`.

**Keypoints.**

- Declared without the `static` keyword.
- Requires an instance of the outer class to be instantiated.
- Can access all members of the outer class.

Non-static inner classes are used when you need access to instance-specific data of the outer class.

<div style="border-left:4px solid #da5233;background:rgba(218,82,51,0.08);padding:0.6rem 1rem;border-radius:0 0.5rem 0.5rem 0;margin:1.25rem 0">

⚠️ **Watch out.** A non-static inner class object always carries an implicit reference back to the outer instance that created it (`outerObj.new InnerClass()` makes that reference explicit). Hold on to an inner-class instance longer than you need to, and you keep its outer object alive too — a classic memory-leak trap in long-lived caches or listener registrations.

</div>

### Local inner classes

Local inner classes are defined within a method or a block of code. They are only accessible within the scope of that method or block. Local inner classes can access all members of the outer class but can only access the effectively final local variables of the enclosing method.

Consider the code snippet given below:

```java
import java.util.*;

class OuterClass {
    void outerMethod() {
        int localVar = 10; // Effectively final

        // class defined inside a method
        class LocalInnerClass {
            void display() {
                System.out.println("Local variable: " + localVar);
            }
        }

        LocalInnerClass localInner = new LocalInnerClass();
        localInner.display(); // Output: Local variable: 10
    }
}

// Main Class
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass outerObj = new OuterClass();
        outerObj.outerMethod();
    }
}
```

In the example, `LocalInnerClass` accesses the `localVar` because it is effectively final.

**Keypoints.**

- Defined within a method or block.
- Can access all members of the outer class.
- Can only access effectively final local variables of the enclosing method.

Local inner classes are useful for encapsulating logic within a method.

### Anonymous inner classes

Anonymous inner classes are a type of local inner class without a name. They are often used to implement interfaces or extend classes for one-time use.

Consider the following code snippet:

```java
import java.util.*;

abstract class Greeting {
    abstract void sayHello();
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Anonymous inner class
        Greeting greeting = new Greeting() {
            void sayHello() {
                System.out.println("Hello, World!");
            }
        };

        greeting.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, World!
    }
}
```

In the example, an instance of the `Greeting` class is created with an overridden `sayHello()` method, allowing custom behavior without explicitly defining a new class.

**Keypoints.**

- Do not have a name.
- Are instantiated at the point of declaration.
- Typically used when a class is needed only once.

Anonymous inner classes are commonly used in GUI applications or when implementing event listeners.

## Your Turn — Practice: Inner Classes

Put all four kinds of inner class to work inside one `Robot`: a non-static inner class, a static nested class, a local class, and an anonymous class — each with its own access to the outer object.

````problem
Design a `Robot` class that demonstrates the four kinds of inner class.

**Class `Robot`**

- Attribute: `name` (`String`); method `performAction()` prints `<name> is performing an action.`.
- **Non-static inner class `Arm`** — `pickItem()` prints `<name> arm picking an item.`.
- **Static nested class `Processor`** — `process()` prints `Processor analyzing the data.`.
- **Local inner class** inside `manageSensors()` — a `Sensor` whose `sense()` prints `<name> sensor detecting obstacles.`.
- **Anonymous inner class** in `executeTask()` — implements a nested interface `Task { execute(); }` to print `<name> executing a custom task.`.

**Input format.** One line on standard input: the robot's `name`. The provided `Main` exercises each inner class in turn, printing a blank line between the five messages.

**Example 1** — Input: `Robot-1`

```text
Robot-1 is performing an action.

Robot-1 arm picking an item.

Processor analyzing the data.

Robot-1 sensor detecting obstacles.

Robot-1 executing a custom task.
```
````

```java run
import java.util.*;

class Robot {
    private String name;

    public Robot(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void performAction() {
        // TODO: print "<name> is performing an action."
    }

    // Non-static inner class — can read the outer Robot's `name`.
    class Arm {
        public void pickItem() {
            // TODO: print "<name> arm picking an item."
        }
    }

    // Static nested class — no outer instance, so no access to `name`.
    static class Processor {
        public void process() {
            // TODO: print "Processor analyzing the data."
        }
    }

    public void manageSensors() {
        // Local inner class — declared inside a method.
        class Sensor {
            public void sense() {
                // TODO: print "<name> sensor detecting obstacles."
            }
        }
        Sensor sensor = new Sensor();
        sensor.sense();
    }

    public void executeTask() {
        // Anonymous inner class — implements Task inline, one-time use.
        Task task = new Task() {
            @Override
            public void execute() {
                // TODO: print "<name> executing a custom task."
            }
        };
        task.execute();
    }

    interface Task {
        void execute();
    }
}

// The driver is complete — fill in the print statements above.
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String name = sc.nextLine().trim();

        Robot robot = new Robot(name);
        robot.performAction();
        System.out.println();

        Robot.Arm arm = robot.new Arm();
        arm.pickItem();
        System.out.println();

        Robot.Processor processor = new Robot.Processor();
        processor.process();
        System.out.println();

        robot.manageSensors();
        System.out.println();

        robot.executeTask();
    }
}
```

```testcases
{
  "args": [
    { "id": "name", "label": "Robot name", "type": "string" }
  ],
  "cases": [
    { "args": { "name": "Robot-1" }, "expected": "Robot-1 is performing an action.\n\nRobot-1 arm picking an item.\n\nProcessor analyzing the data.\n\nRobot-1 sensor detecting obstacles.\n\nRobot-1 executing a custom task." },
    { "args": { "name": "Wall-E" }, "expected": "Wall-E is performing an action.\n\nWall-E arm picking an item.\n\nProcessor analyzing the data.\n\nWall-E sensor detecting obstacles.\n\nWall-E executing a custom task." }
  ]
}
```

````editorial
Each inner class shows a different relationship to the outer object. `Arm` (non-static) carries an implicit reference to its `Robot`, so it can read `name` — and is created with the unusual `robot.new Arm()` syntax. `Processor` (static nested) has no such link, so it can't see `name` and is built as `new Robot.Processor()`. The local `Sensor` lives only inside `manageSensors()` yet still captures `name`, and the anonymous `Task` implements the interface inline for a single use. All four can reach the enclosing instance's members except the `static` one — that's the distinction the exercise is drilling.

```java solution
import java.util.*;

class Robot {
    private String name;

    public Robot(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void performAction() {
        System.out.println(name + " is performing an action.");
    }

    class Arm {
        public void pickItem() {
            System.out.println(name + " arm picking an item.");
        }
    }

    static class Processor {
        public void process() {
            System.out.println("Processor analyzing the data.");
        }
    }

    public void manageSensors() {
        class Sensor {
            public void sense() {
                System.out.println(name + " sensor detecting obstacles.");
            }
        }
        Sensor sensor = new Sensor();
        sensor.sense();
    }

    public void executeTask() {
        Task task = new Task() {
            @Override
            public void execute() {
                System.out.println(name + " executing a custom task.");
            }
        };
        task.execute();
    }

    interface Task {
        void execute();
    }
}

class Main {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String name = sc.nextLine().trim();

        Robot robot = new Robot(name);
        robot.performAction();
        System.out.println();

        Robot.Arm arm = robot.new Arm();
        arm.pickItem();
        System.out.println();

        Robot.Processor processor = new Robot.Processor();
        processor.process();
        System.out.println();

        robot.manageSensors();
        System.out.println();

        robot.executeTask();
    }
}
```

## Summary

- **Abstraction** hides implementation details behind a simpler interface, achieved in Java through **abstract classes** (can mix abstract and concrete methods, hold state, be extended) and **interfaces** (a pure contract, implicitly `public static final` fields, implemented rather than extended).
- Both abstract classes and interfaces can carry **static methods** (called on the type itself) and, since Java 8, interfaces can carry **default methods** (a body, overridable, added without breaking existing implementers).
- The **static keyword** marks a variable, method, or block as belonging to the class rather than any instance — static variables are shared across all objects, static methods can only touch other static members, and static blocks run once when the class loads.
- Java has four kinds of **inner classes**: static nested classes (no outer-instance link), non-static inner classes (carry an implicit reference to their outer instance — watch for memory leaks), local inner classes (scoped to a method, see effectively-final locals), and anonymous inner classes (no name, one-time use, common for interface/abstract-class implementations).
