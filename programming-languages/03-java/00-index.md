title: Java
summary: A single progressive Java text, absolute beginner to advanced. Thirty-five tutorials in strict read order, each deriving the language's behaviour from one generative idea rather than listing features — built on verified, compiled-and-run code and a three-move "Intuition" standard that turns rules into things you can re-derive. The throughline: the compiler is a proof-checker you run before your program ever touches data.

# Java

Most Java tutorials hand you a pile of features and ask you to remember them. This one does the opposite: it finds the **one generative idea** under each topic and shows every rule as a *consequence* of it. You should finish each chapter able to re-derive the rules, not just recite them — and able to predict what a snippet prints, or *whether it even compiles*, before you run it.

The book is a single text, read top to bottom. It starts assuming **you have never written a line of code in any language** and ends on generics, concurrency, the memory model, and modern idioms. Early chapters introduce every term before using it; later chapters assume the earlier ones are done and move at a fluent reader's pace. What never changes is the standard of explanation: every claim is backed by code that was actually compiled and run, and every rule comes with its cost. One idea recurs from the first page to the last — **Java checks your program twice, at compile time and at run time, and the two stages fail in different ways** — so learning to read both kinds of message is learning the language.

## Reading conventions

- **Every code block with a Run button is real.** Cortex compiles and runs it in a sandboxed **Java 21 (OpenJDK)** runner — the same one that produced every `Output:` block in this book. Click ▶ Run, edit the code, run it again. The output you see is the output we verified.
- **When the lesson is a compile error, the block is labelled `Compiler error:`** and shows the real `javac` diagnostic — because in Java, many of the most important lessons happen *before* the program runs.
- **Blocks without a Run button are deliberate** — short fragments, or programs shown precisely because they need keyboard input the sandbox can't supply. Their output is still shown and still real.
- **Every chapter is built on a thesis** stated in its first paragraph, and a fixed rhythm: concept → code → verified output → analysis ("what happened") → an **Intuition** box ("why it must be so").

📘 **How to read the Intuition boxes.** Each one is built in three moves:

1. **The mechanism** — what the compiler and the JVM are *actually doing*.
2. **A concrete bite** — a specific, runnable failure (often a real compiler error), shown so the trap is visible.
3. **The earned rule** — the decision heuristic, now justified rather than asserted, plus its cost.

This note repeats, word for word, at the top of every chapter, so a returning reader can skip it.

## The six tiers

The book climbs six tiers. Earlier tiers are prerequisites for later ones; topics that matter most return later at greater depth (the **spiral** — e.g. `==` vs `.equals` gets a gentle pass with strings in Tier 0, a rigorous "object model" pass in Tier 2, and a third pass in the `equals`/`hashCode` contract in Tier 3, each referencing back rather than re-teaching).

## Three reading paths

**Path A — Your first programming language ever.** Start at Tutorial 1 and walk straight through. Do not skip; each chapter assumes the one before it. Type every example, then change it and predict the new output — or whether it still compiles — before running. Tiers 0–1 are the whole game at first: values, decisions, loops, methods. Everything after is built on those.

**Path B — You program in another language, new to Java.** Skim Tier 0 for the syntax and the surprises (integer division truncates, `int` overflow wraps silently, `==` vs `.equals`), then slow down at **Tier 2 — Classes & Objects**. The reference model (stack vs heap, values vs references, aliasing) and the equality/`hashCode` contract are where Java differs most from scripting-language mental models, and where transferred assumptions cause the subtlest bugs.

**Path C — You know Java, filling gaps.** Use the tier map to find your boundary and read forward. The highest-leverage deep passes are the object model (15), `equals`/`hashCode` (19), generics and erasure (20), the Streams API (28), and concurrency with the memory model (29–32).

## A note on the runner

Every runnable block compiles and runs in an isolated **Java 21 (OpenJDK)** sandbox — no setup, no install, nothing to break. The sandbox compiles your code as a class named `Main`, so the examples here use that name; each block runs on its own (state does not carry from one block to the next), so self-contained examples repeat any setup they need. Anonymous runs work; signing in lets you edit-and-run and raises your hourly quota. One limit worth knowing early: the sandbox cannot pause to read keyboard input, so the interactive `Scanner(System.in)` programs in [Tutorial 5](/synapse/programming-languages/java/first-steps/input-and-output) are shown statically, each paired with a runnable twin that reads from a fixed source. You do **not** need Java installed locally to read this book — though by Tier 5 you'll want it, and Tutorial 35 shows how to set it up properly.
